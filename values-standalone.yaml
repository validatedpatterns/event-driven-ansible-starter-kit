  # Explicitly mention the cluster-state based overrides we plan to use for this pattern.
  # We can use self-referential variables because the chart calls the tpl function with these variables defined
  sharedValueFiles:

  # sharedValueFiles is a flexible mechanism that will add the listed valuefiles to every app defined in the
  # applications section.
  #
  # This kind of variable substitution will work with any of the variables the Validated Patterns operator knows
  # about and sets, so this is also possible, for example:
  #   - '/overrides/values-{{ $.Values.global.hubClusterDomain }}.yaml'
  #   - '/overrides/values-{{ $.Values.global.localClusterDomain }}.yaml'
